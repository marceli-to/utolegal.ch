        text: "In art law, we regularly deal with domestic and foreign transactions of art objects, loan, transport, and insurance contracts, with damage cases, authenticity, and restitution matters, as well as with legal issues regarding the interna-tional transfer of cultural property. We advise artists or com-missioners on contracts for work (especially art in architec-ture), heirs and last will executors on dealing with an artist's estate. We support artists, galleries, museums, and collec-tors in contractual and copyright issues and represent their interests in court"
